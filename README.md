# AIMS — AI-Enhanced Library Management System (Skeleton)

This repository is a skeleton-only starting point for the AIMS project. It's designed for learning and extension:

- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- Communication: Axios (frontend -> backend)

Important: This scaffold intentionally leaves some parts incomplete (e.g., .env settings, CORS), and contains TODOs and mock functions. The goal is for you to wire up database access and AI logic yourself.

Clue: Look into `backend/src/services/aiService.ts` and `frontend/src/services/api.ts` for the connection points.

Happy hacking! 🔧
