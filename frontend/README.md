AIMS Frontend (Skeleton)

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold intended for learning. The API base URL is read from `VITE_API_URL`. The backend is expected to be at `http://localhost:4000/api` by default.

Important: Some configuration is intentionally left incomplete. Set `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` in this folder or a top-level `.env` to match your backend.

Where to implement logic:
- `src/services/api.ts` — set baseURL
- `src/pages` and `src/components` — add UI and real behavior
